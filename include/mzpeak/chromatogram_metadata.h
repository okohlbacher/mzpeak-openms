/**
 * Per-chromatogram descriptive metadata.
 *
 * Read from the `chromatogram` struct column of a nested metadata table, or
 * from the top-level columns of a split-layout primary file.  The precursor and
 * selected-ion facets reuse the spectrum types: on disk they are the same
 * structures, joined the same way.
 *
 * @note There is deliberately no `products` member.  An SRM/MRM transition's Q3
 * isolation window belongs in a product facet, and the specification defines
 * one — but no reference writer emits it and the reference reader reaches an
 * unimplemented branch when it meets one.  Exposing an always-empty `products`
 * would suggest a chromatogram simply had no product, which for an SRM trace is
 * false.  Callers that need Q3 must be told it is unavailable, not handed an
 * empty vector; see @ref has_unreadable_product.
