 * Access to a single spectrum in an MzPeak file.

 * peak decode behind mz()/intensity() is serialised with `std::call_once`, and
 * copies of a `Spectrum` share one decode, so the arrays are materialised
 * exactly once no matter how many copies or threads ask for them.
 *
 * What is NOT safe is driving one `Spectra` (or the `Data::Signals` behind it)
 * from several threads at once: decoding two DIFFERENT spectra concurrently
 * still funnels through the same Parquet reader, whose thread-safety is not
 * established.  **Use one `Spectra` per thread.**
