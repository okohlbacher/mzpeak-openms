/******************************************************************************/
/// The Arrow memory pool Parquet decoding allocates from: the decoded arrays,
/// Parquet's page and decompression buffers, and the column-chunk reads under
/// them.
///
/// WHY NOT MALLOC.  A decoded row group is freed by whichever reader evicts
/// it from the shared RowGroupCache, which is rarely the thread that decoded
/// it.  glibc returns a freed chunk to the arena of the thread that ALLOCATED
/// it, so every decoding thread's arena ends up holding about one freed group
/// (~26 MB) that only that thread would ever reuse: 3.56 GB in 137 arenas at
/// 128 threads, and RSS that grows with the thread count.  Arrow's bundled
/// jemalloc and mimalloc are no way out either: they have crashed on a buffer
/// freed after the thread that allocated it had exited (see Parquet::Impl),
/// and a consumer's OpenMP or std::async threads come and go.
///
/// WHAT IT DOES.  Buffers of kMinBlock and more are whole blocks mapped from
/// the OS, their size rounded up to a size class (four per power of two, so
/// at most 25% over the request, and only in VIRTUAL memory: a page costs RSS
/// once it is written).  A freed block goes onto its class's free list, shared
/// by all threads, and the next request of that class on any thread takes the
/// most recently freed one.  Which thread frees a block, and whether the
/// thread that mapped it still exists, does not matter.  Smaller buffers, and
/// any alignment above 64, go to Arrow's system allocator as before.
///
/// On Linux the blocks are backed by transparent huge pages: smaller ones are
/// carved from 64 MB regions, and blocks of 2 MB and more are mapped on their
/// own, both 2 MB-aligned and advised for huge pages.  A fresh 4 KB page costs
/// ~10 us to fault in with a hundred threads running, and 4 KB faults were
/// what separated this pool from Arrow's jemalloc on speed: the ~4 MB column
/// chunks Arrow's eight I/O threads read for every reader took 8x longer into
/// fresh 4 KB pages than into warm memory.  Measured at 128 threads: minor
/// faults 1.0 -> 0.5 million, wall 3.8 -> 3.3 s, same RSS.  The price is RSS
/// in 2 MB steps: a block's untouched class slack is resident once its huge
/// page is.
///
/// A block's size follows from the size Arrow passes to Free() and
/// Reallocate(), which Arrow's MemoryPool contract makes the size last
/// allocated (jemalloc's sized deallocation depends on the same); the pool
/// keeps no per-block record.
///
/// THE BOUND.  Freed blocks are kept only while
///
///   cached <= max(retain_floor, peak / 4, peak - live)
///
/// where live is the bytes of allocated blocks and peak its high-water mark
/// over the current and the previous second; the oldest-freed blocks beyond
/// that are unmapped.  So the pool's footprint (live + cached) stays within
/// its own recent peak plus a quarter: memory an eviction burst releases is
/// kept for the decodes the burst made room for, the quarter absorbs the
/// churn of blocks whose size class does not come back at once, and nothing
/// goes to an arena that strands it.  A peak that has passed is released on
/// the next allocation or free two seconds on.
///
/// Chosen over a fixed-cap free list and over per-row-group slabs by replaying
/// a recorded allocation trace (128 threads, 347 groups); the numbers are in
/// the commit message.
