   * this, each `Index::spectra()` built its own -- and since the only safe way
   * to read one archive from N threads is one `Spectra` per thread, that was N
   * copies of the same table.  A shared `Index` now pays for it once.
   *
   * Thread-safe: concurrent callers serialise on the build and the later ones
   * find it cached.  The returned map is const and shared, so readers on
   * different threads may hold it simultaneously.
