/**
 * A row group's declared-sorted key column, held as RUNS instead of as a column.
 *
 * In the point layout every peak row carries its spectrum index: 8 bytes of a
 * ~21-byte row, ~40% of a decoded group, for a column that says nothing but
 * "rows a..b belong to spectrum s".  When the column really is sorted, that is
 * all it can say, so a decoded group keeps one (value, first row) pair per
 * spectrum -- ~2,100 of them for a 1,048,576-row group -- and the key's place in
 * every batch is taken by a zero-byte null placeholder, so every other column
 * keeps its position.
 *
 * Why the runs are built FROM THE COLUMN, not from the metadata's per-spectrum
 * point counts: counts and footer statistics cannot prove where one spectrum
 * ends and the next begins.  A file whose counts for two neighbouring spectra
 * are swapped still sums to the table's row count and still agrees with every
 * row group's min/max, yet puts the boundary in the wrong place -- and then
 * the decode's own count check, the one thing that catches a mislocated
 * spectrum, would compare the ranges against the very counts they came from.
 * So the column is read once per decode, in 64 K-value chunks through the
 * low-level reader (never as an 8 MB array), and checked as it is read.
 *
 * A group is held this way only when all of these hold, and is otherwise
 * decoded in full exactly as before:
 *   - the footer declares the column the first sorting column, ascending,
 *     nulls last (run_key_leaf());
 *   - it is a non-repeated INT64 leaf that decodes to Arrow int64 or uint64,
 *     one or two levels deep, and not the table's only leaf;
 *   - it has no null: the read gets exactly one value per row, which a chunk
 *     only holds when no row is null (a null runs the values out first);
 *   - its values never DECREASE, in the order of that Arrow type -- which is
 *     what makes each value's rows one contiguous run, and exactly the run a
 *     binary search over the column finds.  A file that declares sorted and is
 *     not keeps its column, so its behaviour does not change either.
