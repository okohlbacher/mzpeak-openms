 * one.  Measured on a 7,534-spectrum Thermo run: 26.7 MB, ~3.5 KB per spectrum,
 * of which the CV-parameter lists are most of the ALLOCATION count -- five
 * separate small vectors per MS2 spectrum (scan, activation, isolation window,
 * selected ion, spectrum), each one a malloc whose rounding costs more than the
 * bytes it holds.
 *
 * `Lean` drops exactly those, plus scan windows and auxiliary arrays.  Every
 * field a peak decode or a spectrum-selection query reads -- id, ms_level,
 * retention time, polarity, representation, point counts, base peak, TIC,
 * precursors with their isolation windows and selected ions, and the m/z delta
 * model -- is present in both modes.  Nothing the reader itself depends on is
 * behind this flag.
